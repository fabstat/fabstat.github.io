## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar"  src="/fabiana.jpg" alt="Picture of Fabiana" >}}

I am a Ph.D. student at the <a href="http://math.wsu.edu" target="_blank">Mathematics and Statistics Department</a> of <a href="http://vancouver.wsu.edu" target="_blank">Washington State University</a>. My research interests are broad, ranging from applying state-space models to ecological problems to topological data analysis (TDA).

Currently, I am working with my advisor <a href="http://www.math.wsu.edu/faculty/bkrishna/" target="_blank">Bala Krishnamoorthy</a> on the application of TDA tools to problems in artificial and biological neural networks. My goal is to gain structural insight on how both machines and humans use input to make decisions, in order to better understand learning in these two settings.

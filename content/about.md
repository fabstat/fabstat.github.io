## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar"  src="/fabiana.jpg" alt="Picture of Fabiana" >}}

I am currently working on a postdoc at <a href="https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/" target="_blank">Tohoku University</a>. My research focuses on applied mathematics and statistics, specifically Topological Data Analysis and Machine Learning. Current projects include collaboration with material scientists and operations researchers. I also serve as an academic mentor at <a href="https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/student-research-programs/graduate-level-research-in-industrial-projects-for-students-g-rips-sendai-2024/?tab=overview" target="_blank">G-RIPS Sendai</a>, a graduate internship program where students from the US and Japan work together to solve problems from industry.

I received my Ph.D. in Statistical Science from <a href="http://math.wsu.edu" target="_blank">Washington State University</a> in June, 2024. While a graduate student, I worked as an intern at <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov" target="_blank">PNNL</a>'s Data Science group.

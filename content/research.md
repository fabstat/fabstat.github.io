Topological data analysis (TDA) is a subfield of algebraic topology whose
application to areas of study outside mathematics is becoming more and more
common. Two such areas of interest to me are neuroscience and computer science.
In neuroscience, TDA has been applied to EEG signals, fMRI data and connectomes
to study both implicit and explicit topological structures of brain states and
function. In computer science, specifically in the fields of machine learning
and networks, TDA has been used to both take the topology of the input data into
account in order to inform models, as well as to incorporate topological
information directly into the design of models. TDA helps us extract topological
features from the data and use this information to better understand and learn
from the data, and along with statistical tools and approaches, we can discuss
the significance of such features. My research will focus on answering important
structural questions about how both biological and artificial neural networks
function through the study of topological features and their statistical
significance.
